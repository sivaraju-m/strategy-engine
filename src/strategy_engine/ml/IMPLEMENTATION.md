## End-to-End Example

The `build_trading_model.py` script demonstrates a complete workflow:
1. Fetch historical data for a ticker using yfinance
2. Generate technical indicators as features
3. Create trading signals based on strategy rules (momentum, RSI, or MACD)
4. Train an ML model to predict signals
5. Evaluate and save the model

## Next Steps and Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the future:
1. Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
2. More sophisticated feature selection
3. Ensemble methods combining multiple models
4. Pipeline for regular model retraining
5. A/B testing framework for strategy comparison
6. Integration with backtesting module for strategy validation
7. Automated data quality checks and anomaly detection
